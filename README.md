Predicting the Likelihood of E-Signing a Loan Based on Financial History

The Model Building Process is composed of multiple parts:

1.Plotting with Matplotlib and Seaborn - A lot of time will be spent on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2.Data Manipulation - We will use Pandas and Numpy for all of our data formatting steps.
3.Classification Models from Sklearn Library (Logistic Regression, Tree, SVM, ...)
4.K-Fold Cross Validation, Grid Search (Parameter Tuning), and Feature Selection algorithms.
